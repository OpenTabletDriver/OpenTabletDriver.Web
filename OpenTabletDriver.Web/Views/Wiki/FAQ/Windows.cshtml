    My tablet is not detected?

    <p>
        Please check that your tablet is actually plugged in to your PC. Windows by default will indicate when a device is plugged in
        with a sound.<br/> If you do not get this sound consider replacing the cable (make sure the cable supports both power and data
        transfer).<br/><br/>

        Once you are sure that your tablet is connected to your computer, consider checking if your tablet is supported <a href="/Tablets">here</a>.<br/>
        In most cases we do not support wireless, so please make sure your tablet is connected via its cable.
    </p>
    <h4>It is a supported tablet, but still doesn't detect?</h4>
    <p>
        Please make sure that you have no other tablet drivers on the system. Follow the instructions for
        <a href="https://github.com/X9VoiD/TabletDriverCleanup/releases/latest">TabletDriverCleanup</a> and resume here.<br><br>

        Please check if your tablet requires WinUSB <a href="/Tablets">here</a> (it will say in the notes). If it does, follow the<br>
        <a href="/Wiki/Install/Windows#winusb">instructions</a> and return here. Continue below for troubleshooting instructions if your tablet still isn't detected.<br/><br/>

        If you are running OpenTabletDriver.UX, navigate from the top to the Console tab, if you are running the daemon standalone, look for a log that resembles the following:<br/>

    <h5>Tablet driver interefence</h5>

        <codeblock class="mt-2", language="sh">
            Another tablet driver found: &lt;name&gt;
        </codeblock>
        If you see this log message you should follow the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/X9VoiD/TabletDriverCleanup/releases/latest">TabletDriverCleanup</a>
        if you haven't already, making sure to say yes to everything. If the log entry is still there after following the instructions and restarting OTD, try
        joining our support <a href="/Discord">Discord</a> for further help.<br/>

    <h5>Invalid WinUSB driver installation state.</h5>
        <codeblock class="mt-2", language="sh">
            Failed to open file handle to WinUSB interface
            SafeHandle cannot be null. (Parameter 'pHandle')
        </codeblock>
        This is usually resolved when you restart your PC.<br/><br/>

        If nothing above applies, remove <code>%localappdata%/OpenTabletDriver</code> or the contents of the <code>userdata</code> folder next to the binaries (if applicable).<br/>
        If you still need more help after this, join our Discord and give us a shout in the <code>#support-windows</code> channel, mentioning what you have tried.
    </p>

    <h4>It is not a supported tablet, what can I do about that?</h4>
    <p>
        If you want to add support for your tablet on your own, feel free to look at a similar configuration on our GitHub and our configuration documentation.<br/>
        If you would like help with supporting your tablet, or would prefer us to do it join our <a href="/Discord">Discord</a> and toss a message in <code>#configs</code> or a support channel.

        If your area/bindings not working correctly, try following our troubleshooting steps below.<br/><br/>

        Make sure that you have saved your settings by pressing the save button in the bottom right of the OpenTabletDriver interface.<br/><br/>

        If you have done the above and your settings still do not apply then make sure that you don't have other drivers installed on your computer,
        you can remove these by running and following the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/X9VoiD/TabletDriverCleanup/releases/latest">TabletDriverCleanup</a>,
        come back here.<br/><br/>

        If your cursor is teleporting you usually have another driver installed or you have broken settings, you can resolve the former by following the former with
        <a href="https://github.com/X9VoiD/TabletDriverCleanup/releases/latest">TabletDriverCleanup</a> and you can solve the latter with
        <code>file &gt; reset to defaults</code> and clicking save.<br/><br/>

        If you still can't get your issue resolves with the instructions above please join our <a href="/Discord">Discord</a> for extra assistance.

    My cursor doesn't function correctly in osu!
</h3>
<div class="ms-3">
    <p>
        Either disable <code>Raw Input</code> in the game settings entirely or disable <code>Map raw input to osu! window</code>
        in the ingame settings and make sure that sensitivity is set to 1x.<br/>
        <small class="text-muted">
            Note: OpenTabletDriver has since v0.4.0 supported Raw Input as it uses the Windows SendInput API to position the cursor.
            Therefore, it is not necessary to disable raw input itself, but it provides no merit on tablets to have it enabled.
